# YelpCamp

This project was created following the videos of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) at Udemy. This is a simple CRUD (create - read - update - delete) app for creating campgrounds, utilizing the following technologies:

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* EJS
* PassportJS

## What's Next

Right now I'm working on UI improvements and functionality, along with adding new features.

These are the following tasks to be done (in no specific order):

* Make site responsive
* Add multiple authentication strategies
* Add search
* Add rating system
* Comment ranking
* Sorting by rate, price, date created, etc.
* User profiles
* Google Maps location
